# Viola Jones 
This repo contains an end-to-end implemenation of the Viola Jones algorithm for real-time face detection.
As part of of my pasion to CV algorithms I have decided to chalange myself to implement a real-time algorithm for scratch.
In the repo you will find everyhing that is needed to implement Viola Jonas. From a simple Filter classes to weak and strong classifier class, data collection, filters generation and more. 

In order to run real-time face detection please follow the following steps:
## Step 1 
1. unzip filter.zip
2. pickle.zip

## Step 2 
cd scripts

## Strp 3
python main.py # notice that you can update the parmaters under the __main__ setion in order to train/test you algorithm (please add your own data train/test data under data/train and data/test respectivly).

Enjoy!
